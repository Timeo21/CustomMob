# CustomMob
My first plugin that add custom mobs to the game.

## Mobs
### AlphaWolf
  Summon periodicly pups that attack the player, if the AlphaWolf die, pups become angry and grow into Angry Wolf.
### Pup
  Little wolf that attack the player to defend the AlphaWolf.
### Angry Wolf
  When the AlphaWolf die all remaining pups become Angry Wolf, they get bigger and has more health.
  
### BroodMother
  a Boss spider with a lots of health, that summon more Baby spider has it life decrease.
  The BroodMother is totally stationary until it get less that a third of it life.
### Baby Spider
  Baby Spider are constantly summon by the BroodMother to protect it, they walk around there mother and attack any player close enough.
  Once the BroodMother die every Baby Spider despawn.
### WildFire
  A nether Boss that is very similar to the Mob D of the Minecon Mob Vote 2017.
  It's look like a Blaze with large plate that turn around to protect itself from arrows, and some other projectiles.
  It can shoot fireball that do a bigger explosion than regular blaze.
  Multiple times after receiving enough damage it spawns many Guarding Blaze that prevents it of taking damage.
### Guarding Blaze
  Basically a blaze.
  Killing all of them make the WildFire vulnerable again.
### Turret [WIP]
  A turret that is perfectly stationary and resistant to knockback. It shoot arrows towards the players up to 30 blocks away.
### Vampire [WIP]
  A mob that looks like a player but when receive to much damage at once transform into bat and summon multiple bats to disctract the player.
  
## Work In Progress
 there is currently no loot for any of these mobs and they don't spawn naturally.
 Spawn Egg can be obtain with the command : /giveegg <mob> (alphawolf,broodmother,wildfire,turret (vampire is not added yet))
 Mob can be remove using command : /killmob [optional radius, default = 20]
